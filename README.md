# JHU EN.600.226: Data Structures
Prof: [Michael Schatz](http://schatz-lab.org) (mschatz @ cs.jhu.edu) <br>
Head TA: [Tim Kutcher](https://github.com/tkutche1) (tkutche1 @ jhu.edu) <br>
Class Hours: Monday + Wednesday + Friday @ 1:30p - 2:45p in Mudd 26 <br>
Schatz Office Hours: Wednesday @ 3-4p in Malone 323 and by appointment <br>

**The primary goal of the course is for students to be grounded in theory and leave the course empowered to understand and implement a variety of key data structures.** 
This course covers the design and implementation of data structures including arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees, heaps, balanced trees (e.g. 2-3 trees, AVL-trees) and graphs. Other topics include sorting, hashing, memory allocation, and garbage collection. Course work involves both written homework and Java programming assignments. 
- Upon successful completion of this course, you should be able to:
  - Evaluate and compare the time complexity of functions using mathematical techniques.
  - Design an algorithm that produces the correct results according to specified inputs and time or space complexity constraints.
  - Understand the operation of common data structures and algorithms.
  - Use analysis techniques to choose the data structure/implementation appropriate for a given problem.
  - Write advanced object-oriented solutions in Java to significant problems, by implementing appropriate data structures and algorithms.

### Prerequisites
- Class Prerequisities (Programming in Java is required)
  - EN.600.120 OR EN.601.220 OR EN.600.107 OR EN.601.107 or equivalent with C+ or better grades. 
- Recommended Prerequisites
  - [Code academy's Intro to Unix](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/environment/exercises/bash-profile)
  - [Command line bootcamp](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=9xnbkx6eaof)
  - Access to a Linux Machine, and/or Install [VirtualBox](https://github.com/schatzlab/appliedgenomics2018/blob/master/assignments/virtualbox.md) (Unfortuantely, even Mac will not work correctly for some programs)
